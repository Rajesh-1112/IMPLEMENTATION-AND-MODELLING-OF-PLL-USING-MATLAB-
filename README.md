# Implementation of PLL Using MATLAB

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design, simulation, and analysis of a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) system using MATLAB and Simulink. The primary objective is to achieve frequency and phase synchronization between an input signal and the output of a locally generated oscillatorâ€”an essential function in electronic and communication systems. The project explores PLL behavior under various conditions and evaluates its effectiveness in maintaining phase and frequency coherence.

## What is a PLL?

A Phase Locked Loop (PLL) is a feedback control system that automatically adjusts the phase of a locally generated signal to match the phase of an input signal. PLLs are widely used in clock generation, frequency synthesis, demodulation, and carrier recovery in communication systems.

### Basic Architecture

A typical PLL comprises three main components:

- **Phase Detector (PD) / Phase Frequency Detector (PFD):** Compares the phase and frequency of the input and feedback signals, generating error signals ("UP" or "DOWN") to indicate the required adjustment.
- **Loop Filter (LF):** Processes the error signal to produce a smooth control voltage, filtering out high-frequency noise.
- **Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO):** Adjusts its output frequency based on the control voltage, aiming to minimize the phase error.

### Types of PLLs Covered

- Linear PLL (Analog)
- Digital PLL
- All-Digital PLL
- Soft PLL (Adaptive)

### Key Terms

- **Lock-in Range:** Frequency range over which the PLL can maintain lock.
- **Capture Range:** Frequency range within which the PLL can acquire lock.
- **Pull-in Time:** Time required to achieve lock.
- **Bandwidth:** Frequency range over which the PLL can track input changes.

## Simulink Model

The Simulink block diagram of the PLL implementation includes:

- **Input Signal Source:** Generates the input waveform.
- **Gain Blocks (10 and 20):** Scale the input and feedback signals.
- **Summing Junction:** Combines the scaled input and feedback signals to produce a phase error.
- **Integrator (1/s):** Integrates the phase error, simulating the loop filter.
- **Frequency and Phase Conversion:** The integrated signal is multiplied by \(2\pi\) and passed through a cosine function to generate the VCO output.
- **VCO and Output Path:** The VCO output is scaled and fed back into the loop as well as to the output scope.
- **Matrix Multiply, Butterworth Filter, and Continuous-Time VCO:** Used for additional signal processing and filtering, modeling real-world PLL behavior.
- **Scope:** Captures and displays the signals for analysis.
